## Coding

I am Raf Rasenberg, a Dutch ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Software Engineer & Business Owner. I help businesses and start-ups with building out efficient web applications using mainly Django & JavaScript.

Started out with making websites in WordPress in 2018 and gradually moved away from this, focussing on custom web applications and CMS systems. Since then the projects have become larger, more varied and more complex. To see some of the recent projects I shipped through my company, [follow this link](https://webconexus.com/cases/).

I'm a big lover of everything back-end and DevOps related. CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes and Cloud to name some of the IT buzz words. Coming from a business background, non-technical communication and focus on cost-efficient solutions is one my key skills.

#### Skills

## Personal interests

Besides my passion for coding I have a big passion for fitness. On my socials I preach about it a lot and I believe that (especially) developers, should be more conscious about the long-term postive effects of staying active and maintaining a healthy work/life balance.
