## Brand building
Besides web development I have a big interest in business, brand / community building and content creation. I'm a big advocate of creating a healthy work / life balance, which I reflect in my Social Media appareance. :muscle::rocket:

**Current Social Media stats:**
- :bird: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rafrasenberg): {{< followers >}} followers 
- :video_camera: [YouTube](https://youtube.com/rafrasenberg): 1.000 subscribers
- :heart: [Discord](https://discord.gg/7daE6Ue): 1.000 members

What does this say about me? I know how to build out a brand and create audience loyalty. Developing a project is only the first step, you can have a finished product but if you don't have a audience to sell it to, it still won't take off.

When building software projects, I always keep the business aspect in mind. This will help with accelerating the growth process after a successful launch. :trophy:
