## Coding

I am Raf Rasenberg, a Dutch ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Software Engineer with 4 years of experience and a big passion for back-end, cloud, and anything DevOps related. Configuring CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes, serverless and IaC to name a few buzz words.

I focus on delivering high-quality (containerized) -and mostly serverless- software solutions, using clean code methods like TDD in agile environments. Big fan of Linux!

Coming from a business background, non-technical communication and focus on cost-efficient solutions is one my key skills.

#### Core expertise

- Python
- AWS
- Serverless
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- JavaScript

Worked a lot with the frameworks Django, Flask and FastAPI for Python. I enjoy using TypeScript for type safety, and if needed Svelte as an easy JS framework to add interactivy to an app while keeping a minimal bundle size and a code base with a low complexity level.

Currently working as an AWS Cloud Engineer :cloud: at [InQdo Cloud](https://www.inqdo.com/cloud/?lang=en) in The Netherlands.

## Personal interests

Besides my passion for coding I have a big passion for fitness. On my socials I preach about it a lot and I believe that (especially) developers, should be more conscious about the long-term postive effects of staying active and maintaining a healthy work/life balance.
